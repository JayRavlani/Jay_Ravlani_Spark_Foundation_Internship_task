# Student Grade Prediction Using Linear Regression and Python

This project implements a supervised machine learning model using linear regression to predict the percentage a student will achieve based on the number of hours they study. The model is trained on a dataset containing the number of hours studied and the corresponding grades obtained by students.

## Introduction

In this project, we aim to predict the percentage a student will achieve based on the number of hours they study. We utilize linear regression, a simple yet effective supervised machine learning algorithm, to build our predictive model.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains records of students' study hours and their corresponding grades obtained. The dataset is divided into two columns: `Hours` and `Grade`.
